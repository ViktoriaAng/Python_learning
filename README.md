# Python_learning
I cleaned the data by removing respondents who didn't answer the mandatory questions. I calculated the number of respondents who answered all questions, computed statistics on work experience, and found out how many respondents work remotely, use Python, and learned programming through online courses. Additionally, I analyzed salary data by country for Python developers.
